# About Me Whiteboard

## Original

Hi! My name is Bryan and I love building things both on and offline. My interest in
programming began in elementary school: kicking America Online users offline with
Visual Basic. In high school, Adobe Photoshop, HTML & CSS caught my interest. Before
long, I was responsible for 5 local band web sites and eventually took on a few small
paying clients.

Over the years, I have gained experience with BASH, AutoHotkey and PowerShell
scripting to automate both personal and work related activities.

Linux, networking & servers became a part of my life in the late 2010s. In my leisure time, I manage a Dell
PowerEdge R730XD server, running VMWare ESXI and it hosts a virtualized TrueNAS
environment, docker-compose stack, family media server and more. I have dabbled with
reverse proxies (NGiNX), the LAMP stack, WordPress and several Linux distros: Debian,
Ubuntu, Manjaro, Arch, DietPi, Raspbian, etc.

In mid-2022, I narrowed my focus on becoming a professional developer. Following the
Odin Project (view my progress) all of my free time, both after work & on weekends, has gone toward learning the
fundamentals of modern web development. Technology and problem solving have been
lifelong passions of mine and I am excited to share my experience and continue
learning in a professional setting.
